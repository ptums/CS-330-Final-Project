# CS-330:Computer Graphic and Visualization - Final Project

## How do I approach designing software?

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has helped me develop the skills to write complex C++ code for generating 3D graphics, and to gain a deeper understanding of how C++ code interacts with machine components, such as the GPU.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process begins with the primary goal of accomplishing the task at hand. First, you need to ensure the code runs correctly and successfully creates something on the screen. Once you've achieved that, it's time to adjust various aspects of the code to explore their capabilities and limitations. During this phase of experimenting with the code, you'll discover how different areas can be improved. The final step in the design process is to devise ways to optimize the code for enhanced performance and then implement those plans. It's crucial not only for the program to function as intended but also to maintain the code in a legible and highly efficient manner.


### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I think the strategy I outlined above can be applied to all software projects moving forward.

## How do I approach developing programs

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Besides playing around and then optimizing the code, I also learned debugging skills using the Visual Studio debugger and the terminal error messages. The Visual Studio debugger highlighted incorrect code and missing variables, which saved me time in trying to debug them myself. Then the terminal error messages gave me more in-depth insights when my code had issues interacting with the GPU or file path issues

### How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a huge part of the development process. The process was always the same: Get something on the screen and continuously tweak and iterate over it until it looks the way you want it to

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I really like the submission, feedback, implement feedback approach to the milestones. I felt like I was always improving my code, and it is very similar to the process I have with coworkers at work, where we review each other's code and make suggestions for improvement.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I really enjoy C++ as a language and I love that this course utilized it. I had the opportunity to practice writing in C++ while learning about a new aspect of computers, something I didn't know much about.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Sometimes, I forget to take things step by step. In programming, you can't rush through anything. If you don't understand how something works or how to implement a new feature, you need to take a step back and focus on one step at a time.
